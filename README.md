This script is designed to compare the HRLDAS simulated Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) with the gridded U.S. reference SWE dataset (UA SWE) at a specific location (latitude/longitude).

The main tasks performed by this script include:
✅ Extracting the nearest grid point (i, j) of the HRLDAS from target latitude and longitude
✅ Use i,j to extrct time series from HLDAS output and reference UA SWE.
✅ Saving time series from both datasets at a selected location.
✅ Generating a time series plot comparing HRLDAS SNEQV with UA SWE.
